# introduction 

A low-level programming language is a programming language 
that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction 
set architecture—commands or functions in the language map that are 
structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, 
this refers to either machine code or assembly language.
 Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language 
and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being
 "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be 
relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of 
system architecture.

# C programming language 

C is an imperative (procedural) language. All the code has to be inside a function. C files are source code of your program.
You have to compile C files with a compiler (for instance gcc) to create an executable file.

 
 # Comments
Begins with /* and ends with */
Can be inserted anywhere a white-space character is allowed
Comments don’t nest
Use comments to document your code
   

# requirements 

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project

There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation

You are not allowed to use system

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
