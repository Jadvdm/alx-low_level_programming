# introduction 

A low-level programming language is a programming language 
that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction 
set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map that are 
structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, 
this refers to either machine code or assembly language.
 Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language 
and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being
 "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be 
relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of 
system architecture.
